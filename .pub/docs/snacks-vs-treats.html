			<h1>Snacks vs treats</h1>
			<p>Snacks are small things that you eat that are made up of whole foods, such as fruits, and should be eaten between meals, filling up nutritional gaps. Treats are processed foods, that have extra sugar and low nutritional value.</p>

<p>Snacks fuel brain power, promote concentration, nourish the body and provide sustained energy. Treats provide a quick sugar boost and subsequent energy drop, leading to fatigue and hunger.</p>

<p>Treats are often higher in sugar, fat and salt such as chips or cookies, which is unhealthy and increases fatigue and craving, and should be limited.</p>
