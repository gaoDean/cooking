<h1>Buying Fresh</h1>

<h2>Why buy fresh foods?</h2>

<p>Buying food in season are healthier, better for the environment, and overall cheaper to buy.</p>

<h4>Nutrition</h4>
<p>Foods that are grown and consumed during their appropriate seasons are more nutritionally dense. In order for certain fruits and vegetables to be available year-round, post-harvest treatments, known as ripening agents, are used. Mass-produced produce intended to meet global consumer demand tends to suffer from a lack of flavor</p>

<h4>Emissions</h4>
<p>Many foods that are available here are grown overseas, and then flown by airplane to us</p>

<h4>Cost</h4>
<p>Lastly, when fruits or veggies are in season, they are more abundant due to their ease of growth, making them cheaper to grow and buy.</p>


<h2>How do I buy fresh foods?</h2>
<p>Between selection, purchase and preparation there is a lot to consider when buying fresh produce.</p>
<h4>Don't buy foods that are bruised</h4>
<p>You may have been taught that bruised fruit is fine to eat, and it mostly is, but bruises are a great place for bacteria to grow, and overall the fruit is less tasty</p>

<h4>Give a light squeeze</h4>
<p>Before buying the food, give it a light sqeeze</p>

<h4>Smaller fruit</h4>
<p>If the price isn't too high, smaller fruit often have a denser flavour.</p>

<h4>Inspect the color</h4>
<p>Many foods start to change color after being left out too long, for example green apples, when stored too long, start to yellow, and colorful produce may not lead to better produce, as the product is most likely coated with something to make it look more appealing.</p>

<h4>Compare the price</h4>
<p>Prepackaged produce and loose produce often vary in price, so it is a good idea to compare them before buying</p>

<h4>Rinse before consumption</h4>
<p>Foods may have chemicals that the shop sprayed to make it look more appealing, so it is important to give the produce a rinse before consuming</p>


<h4>Farmers market</h4>
<p>The farmers market is a great way to get fresh, great tasting produce, and the food is typically 'cleaner' than produce in the shops, because of the lack of chemicals sprayed onto the food.</p>

<h4>Frequent buying</h4>
<p>Try to buy the freshest food most often, and that means not buying a whole load of food for two weeks, but perhaps going every four or so days to the shops or preferably the farmers market, to top up your stock.</p>


<p>Now some don'ts:</p>
<h4>Don't grab whats in front</h4>
<p>Supermarkets staff are taught to shuffle the food, so the oldest is at the front and the freshest is at the back, abiding by the FIFO (first in first out) rule.</p>

<h4>Don't buy Pre-cut</h4>
<p>Pre-cut vegetables, as convenient as they seem, often cost double what buying the raw vegetable would cost.</p>

<h4>Preventing pesticides in your food</h4>
<p>Most foods are sprayed with varying amounts of pesticides that are bad for the environment and human health</p>

<h4>Go by feel</h4>
<p>Supermarkets often try their best to make food look good, no matter how they taste, but a good metric for fresh food is the skin</p>


<h4>Don't shop on the weekend</h4>
<p>Most supermarket deliveries arrive early in the week to make weekend shoppers buy the oldest food, so you should shop mid-week to get the freshest, cheapest food.</p>
