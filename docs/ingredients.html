<h1>Ingredient Functions</h1>

<p>You might have made something with a recipe before, but did you ever wonder why the food tasted like it tasted, what role does each ingredient play? This article will teach you the basics of ingredient functions, so you can learn from recipes and perhaps create your own, with enough practice.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>There are many ingredients that have special functions in the baking and cooking process</p>

<p>Here are a list of the functions of many popular ingredients you may come across when scouring recipes:</p>

<h3>Dry Ingredients</h3>
<h4>Herbs</h4>
<p>Herbs are fragrant plants used to season foods, and add a bit of extra flavour</p>

<h4>Spices</h4>
<p>Spices have strong flavours and aromas that are used to add flavour to foods</p>

<h4>Salt & Pepper</h4>
<p>Salt is a seasoning that sharpens the flavour of other ingredients, and enhances the sweetness of the food</p>

<h4>Eggs</h4>
<p>Eggs can be eaten on their own but they also serve a big role as a cooking ingredient</p>

<h3>Liquids</h3>
<h4>Extracts</h4>
<p>Extracts are made from extracting the oil from certain foods, and are useful for adding concentrated flavouring to dishes.</p>

<h4>Cream</h4>
<p>Whipped cream (aka Heavy cream, double cream) provides a rich, creamy texture to the foods it is added to</p>


<p>Light cream is used in making soups, sauces, desserts and baked goods</p>


<p>Sour cream has a thick consistency and slightly tangy</p>

<h4>Honey</h4>
<p>Honey is used as a sweetener and has a distinctive flavor that is influenced by the type of flowers and plants that the nectar is taken from.</p>

<h4>Vinegar</h4>
<p>Vinegar adds a sour, pungent taste to the foods it is added to</p>


<h4>Soy sauce</h4>

<p>Soy sauce provides salt, sweet, umami (savory), and even a little bitter flavor</p>

<h4>Butter</h4>
<p>Butter creates flaky pastries, and it provides flavor, tenderness, crispness, and a golden-brown color to many foods</p>

<h4>Oil</h4>

<p>Oil helps food cook evenly, adds flavour, stops it sticking and brings an attractive sheen to the dish.</p>
<p>Olive oil is made by crushing olives into a paste, and results in a grassy oil with a peppery flavour.</p>
<p>Vegetable oil is neutral in flavour and pale in colour, used when there shouldn't be much flavour.</p>
<p>Rice bran oil is extracted from the outer bran or husk of rice grains</p>

<h4>Cooking wine</h4>
<p>Wine has three main uses in the kitchen â€“ as a marinade ingredient, as a cooking liquid, and as a flavoring in a finished dish</p>
